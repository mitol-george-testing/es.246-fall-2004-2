description: The skulls of genocide victims are lined up on shelves at the Ntarama
  Church Memorial in Rwanda, where 5000 people were slaughtered in 1994. The Rwandan
  Genocide killed 800,000 people in only three months, many of whom were massacred
  in schools and churches like this one, where they crowded in hoping for sanctuary.
